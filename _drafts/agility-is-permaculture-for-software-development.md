title: "Agility is permaculture for software development"

---

If you take an interest in sustainable development, and not only of the software kind, you may already be familiar with permaculture.  It is an approach to sustainable living, particularly food production, which seeks to pattern human systems after natural ecosystems.  It aims to reduce our environmental footprint by harnessing natural processes rather than battling them.

Permaculture has some curious parallels with the agile movement, some superficial but others profound, to the extent that the two could be seen as one single approach applied to different domains.

[to write up:]
Self-regulation and feedback
Patterns (Christopher Alexander)
Not in stasis - constant evolution (permaculture: succession; agile: changing requirements)

Permaculture originated in Australia, and its originators wrote for Australia's sub-tropical and warm-temperate climate zones, but this comprehensive book describes permaculture for the humid, cool-temperate British climate (and is applicable to most of North-West Europe).  Relevant to farmers, leisure gardeners and even urban dwellers.</li>
