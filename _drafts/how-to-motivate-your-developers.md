The organisation in which I currently work has a dedicated department for architecture and transverse components.  This department - which I'll call ATC - provides 
architects to project teams, supplies and supports the organisation's set of developer tools, and manages the organisation's Maven repository.  Developers belong 
to the Development Service, a parallel structure.  They are also on a different floor of the building from ATC.  The line manager of all developers is the head of the 
Development Service, but a developer really works for a project manager - who belongs to a third, entirely separate structure, the Customer Pole.  

(The Customer Pole is not the customer organisation: it consists of the project managers and administrators who handle both the budgetary and the 
business interface with the customer organisations.  The customer organisations are the various public departments of the administration.  
Each of these has its own IT department which manages the IT budget, and commissions, specifies and acceptance-tests IT projects.   
I've been told that there are users somewhere out there at the end of the chain.  But that's a story for another day.)

Here's what the architecture department's head recently had to say about the relationship between his department and the organisation's developers:

<blockquote>
ATC makes available to developers a set of methods, patterns, best practices, components, frameworks and tools.  Any request to modify this set, validated and backed up 
by the architect, must be made by the project manager to the Developments Service which will relay it to ATC.  ATC will then reply to the request within a reasonable 
timeframe (all the more reasonable insofar as the requirement is identified in advance).  <strong>In no case should developers make choices of methods, best practices, 
components, frameworks or tools.</strong>  However, their inputs are welcome in the above process.</blockquote>

(Emphasis added.)
