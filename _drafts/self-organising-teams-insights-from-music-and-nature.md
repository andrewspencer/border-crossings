<!-- Notes
Difference between self-organisation and self-determination.
Self-organisation: when a group-level pattern or behaviour is produced through individual agents following simple rules whose inputs require only local information. (cf Couzin, etc)
Individual autonomy: when each member of the group is responsible for taking decisions concerning its own actions.
Self-determination: when each member of the group participates in decisions concerning the choices of the group.
Democracy: when each member of the group is obliged to surrender its autonomy to a leader, and is able to vote on the choice of leader.
Dictatorship: when each member of the group is obliged to surrender its autonomy to a leader, and is unable to vote on the choice of leader.

Musical ensembles without a conductor are rare, especially larger ones.  There <em>are</em> a few conductorless orchestras, but even those are nearly all chamber orchestras (around 25 musicians, rather than 50 or so in a full orchestra) and they are so rare that they almost confirm rather than refute the idea that an orchestra needs a conductor.

Very small ensembles - trios, quartets and quintets - invariably rehease and perform without a conductor or leader.  The transition point between leaderless and led ensembles seems to be somewhere around eight to ten players.  That is also the upper recommended size limit for an agile team, so are the same factors at play ?

Now, a musical performance is quite a different job to producing software.  The musicians need to be far more coordinated during the performance than does a software development team.  Musical performance is more synchronous.  Even if the rehearsals are where most of the real work happens.

Nonetheless, both activities require participants to be on the same page, that is, to reach detailed agreement about the manner in which the job is to be done.  In a self-organised team, that requires every team member to listen to every other team member, and every member to evaluate team performance.  In a command-and-control team, it requires only the leader to evaluate team performance and communicate actions to all team members (but the leader has to be superhuman to manage the volume of information involved).

One key difference between the two activities is that in music, the team's output is a single flow of information, in the form of sound, that a single person can reasonably process (if no-one could, then performing the music would be pointless), and indeed that can <em>only</em> meaningfully be experienced as a single entity.  For a self-organising team to play music, every member must reach agreement on every aspect of the performance.  By contrast, a piece of software can far more easily be divided into orthogonal concerns, and it is possible for an individual to usefully contribute to one aspect without knowing the whole (by working on a single module, or a single aspect such as the graphical theme).

Another key difference is that in music, it is easier for a non-performer to assess the team's performance than for a performer.  The performers are less well placed than the conductor or the audience to hear the balance between players (or singers).  Conductorless orchestras and choirs are notable for adjusting their seating arrangements to alleviate this problem, but it cannot be entirely eradicated, and still makes an extra demand upon the performers.

The difference lies, then, in the feedback dynamics.  Having a single decision-maker is humanly possible in music and pays rewards in efficiency, both in information gathering and decision making.  Why, then, do all ensembles not have a conductor ?  The answer lies in satisfaction: members of conductorless ensembles report a much higher degree of satisfaction with their participation in the group.
