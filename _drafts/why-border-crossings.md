title: "Why 'Border Crossings'?"
---

The title is an allusion to my current life as a cross-border worker.  Growing up in an island nation, crossing an international border was a significant event.  By the age of twenty, I had only been outside my country of birth on three occasions.  Now, I live 2km from an international border and cross it most days.  Border crossings have become as commonplace as getting out of bed in the morning.  I'm still often struck by the strangeness of the event.  There's a dissonance between its apparent banality and its genuine significance: crossing the border means switching to a different set of laws, an entirely different method of government, and even a noticeably different culture.  There's also a dissonance between the importance we humans accord it, and its nonexistence to the rest of nature.  That dissonance, combined with the importance this particular border had within living memory, makes it seem at once slightly ridiculous and distantly sinister.
