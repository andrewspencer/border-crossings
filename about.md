<h3>About this blog</h3>
Border Crossings is a technical blog about enterprise software development in Java, with occasional other subjects.
I haven't posted for a long time now but have kept online as some of the articles still get a few hits.

<h3>About me</h3>
I'm a software engineer, though I trained as a biologist.  I've been coding in Java since 1997, and being paid to do so since 2000.  
Aside from a couple of years doing mobile gaming (long before <del>it was cool</del> there was any money in it), I've worked on enterprise software, both web and Swing.

Aside from writing code, I'm particularly interested in humane and sustainable development.  Professionally, that means code maintainability, 
improving software development processes, and agility.  Outside the professional sphere: music (I sing in 
<a href="http://www.evpierredelune.ch">a classical choir</a>), 
sustainable transport, wholesome food, permaculture.
